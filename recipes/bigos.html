    <p>Polish bigos for me defines traditional Polish cuisine â€“ hearty, deliciously comforting and great for sharing.  
        This dish is equally popular as a family meal (served with mashed potatoes or bread) as well as party food, accompanying all celebrations including weddings, christenings etc. 
        It has withstood the test of time and remains one of the most popular dishes in Poland today</p>
